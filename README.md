# Personal Notes

## Overview

My notes that are related to my personal and work.

I saw this from [Bob's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxgi12c3sEY).

- [Index of all notes](index.md)
- [Structured notes](super_index.md)

## Setup

To create the index, there is currently no dependencies required other than
having Python3 installed.
To work on the script, create a virtual environment and install
`requirements.txt` (run tests).
For the bash scripts will need to install the following:

- fzf.
- bat (batcat).
  - Use deb-get.
- xclip.

## Update Index

To update this, use the [index.py script](index.py).
Make sure that tags are either `#tagname` or `#tag_name` using `_` for spaces.
The tags should be in lowercase.
For structured notes make sure that the super tag are either `##supertag` or
`##super_tag` using `_` for spaces.
See [Structural Layers in Note Taking](notes/20221010144608.md) for more info.

# Pasting Text in Vim

I kept trying to paste text and getting weird indenting or so other odd issue.
A) I forgot about using `:help`. B) That I had `autoindent` turned on.
While looking at help for `autoindent` I found out that I can instead use
`:set paste` to but vim into paste mode and pasting the data will look as
intended.
Then after pasting just use `:set nopaste` to turn off.

#vim #paste #nopaste #autoindent

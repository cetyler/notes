# Application Name in PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL has an `application_name` parameter, which you can set in the
connection string.
It is then possible have it reported in the server's logs and is also part os
the system `pg_stat_activity`.

For example:

```
"postgres://user:pass@127.0.0.1:5432/db_name?application_name=app_name"
```

#application_name #pg_stat_activity
#postgresql #taop #book #the_art_postgresql #dimitri_fontaine
